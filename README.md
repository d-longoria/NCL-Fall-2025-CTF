# NCL-Fall-2025-CTF

## Objective

The NCL Fall 2025 CTF event aimed to test my overall knowledge and skills with Open Source Intelligence, Cryptography, Password Cracking, Log Analysis, Network Traffic Analysis, Forensics, Scanning & Reconnaissance, Web Application Exploitation, and Enumeration & Exploitation.

### Skills Learned
- Development of individual/team critial thinking and problem-solving in cybersecurity
- Analyzing and interpreting network logs and packet captures
- Exploit publicly available information such as search engines, public repositories, social media, and more to gain in-depth knowledge on a topic or target
- Identify techniques used to encrypt or obfuscate messages and leverage tools to extract the plaintext
- Pinpoint types of password hashes and apply various techniques to efficiently determine plaintext passwords
- Utilize the proper tools and techniques to establish a baseline for normal operation and identify malicious activities using log files from various services
- Recognize malicious and benign network traffic to demonstrate an understanding of potential security breaches
- Employ the proper tools and techniques to analyze, process, recover, and/or investigate digital evidence in a computer-related incident
- Seperate and use the proper tools to gain intelligence about a target including its services and potential vulnerabilities
- Determine actionable exploits and vulnerabilities and use them to bypass the security measures in online services, code, and compiled binaries

### Tools Used
- Hashcat: Identfiying hashes and password cracking
- John the Ripper: Password cracking
- Nmap: Discover hosts and services on a computer network
- Netcat: Reading from and writing to network connections with features such as port scanning, file transferring, and port listening
