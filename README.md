# NCL-Fall-2025-CTF

## Objective

The NCL Fall 2025 CTF event aimed to test my overall knowledge and skills with Open Source Intelligence, Cryptography, Password Cracking, Log Analysis, Network Traffic Analysis, Forensics, Scanning & Reconnaissance, Web Application Exploitation, and Enumeration & Exploitation.

### Skills Learned

- Development of individual/team critial thinking and problem-solving in cybersecurity
- Analyzing and interpreting network logs and packet captures
- Exploit publicly available information such as search engines, public repositories, social media, and more to gain in-depth knowledge on a topic or target
- Identify techniques used to encrypt or obfuscate messages and leverage tools to extract the plaintext
- Pinpoint types of password hashes and apply various techniques to efficiently determine plaintext passwords
- Utilize the proper tools and techniques to establish a baseline for normal operation and identify malicious activities using log files from various services
- Recognize malicious and benign network traffic to demonstrate an understanding of potential security breaches
- Employ the proper tools and techniques to analyze, process, recover, and/or investigate digital evidence in a computer-related incident
- Seperate and use the proper tools to gain intelligence about a target including its services and potential vulnerabilities
- Determine actionable exploits and vulnerabilities and use them to bypass the security measures in online services, code, and compiled binaries

### Tools Used

- Hashcat: Identfiying hashes and password cracking
- John the Ripper: Password cracking
- Nmap: Discover hosts and services on a computer network
- Netcat: Reading from and writing to network connections with features such as port scanning, file transferring, and port listening
- WireShark: Packet analyzer
- Autopsy: Performs forensic searches of a computer storage volume
- Python: Programming language used for writing code and simplifying problem-solving of cryptography, steganography, web exploitation challenges, and more
- cyberchef (web): Web app for carrying out all manner of cyber operations within a web browser
- dcode (web): Web app that can decrypt and decipher an encoded message

## A reflection on my CTF experience

The Fall 2025 NCL CTF was an extremely challenging event that put all of the information I learned in past SANS courses to test. The CTF consisted of 3 different games as well as a Gymnasium, which was similar to the practice game but had soulutions/hints to the challenges. The 3 games in the CTF were; the Practice Game running 7 days, the Individual Game running 3 days, and the Team Game also running 3 days. I have never done a CTF challenge before so I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to answer any of the questions, but the Gym was a huge help to me understanding the format and flow of the CTF. After diving into the questions I was becoming a little more confident because I was able to recall a lot of the tools and information that I learned during my SANS GCIH course. However, once I got to the harder questions and certain topics I realized I was stuck.

The first challenge was the Practice Game which ran 1 week long and required a minimum of 60% completion rate of the total questions. I believed that since this was 1 week long, and only a practice, I could take it easy and reach the minimum score with no problem. Except I was wrong. My goal was to complete 1 of the 10 section every day, and with that I would be at around 70% complete. The problem with this, was that would need to get 100% on each section every day. Like I said before, I ran into issues on the harder questions and was unable to solve them, meaning I wasn't going to be able to get 100% on every section. That's when I changed my strategy and tried to answer as many of the questions I could everyday, and not getting stuck on any 1 question or section. Unfortunately, it was too late and I was only able to complete 43.8%.

It was a good and bad thing that I was unable to complete the Practice Game because I then knew what I had to do in order to complete the Individual Game starting 2 weeks later. The individual game also required a 60% minimum completion rate except the real challenge was that it was only 3 days long. It was the same number of sections but even more questions to solve. Going into the game, my strategy was to start strong by starting the Individual Game how I ended the Practice Game. That was, doing as many questions as I could and not getting stuck on any 1 question or section. This worked out great and I was able to make a lot of progress on the first day. However, the second day was were I started to face some burn-out as I was getting stuck on almost every question. I used every resource I could think of from past course material, search engines, and AI tools but it was not enough to answer some of the challenges.
