## A reflection on my CTF experience

The Fall 2025 NCL CTF was an extremely challenging event that put all of the information I learned in past SANS courses to test. The CTF consisted of 3 different games as well as a Gymnasium, which was similar to the practice game but had soulutions/hints to the challenges. The 3 games in the CTF were; the Practice Game running 7 days, the Individual Game running 3 days, and the Team Game also running 3 days. I have never done a CTF challenge before so I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to answer any of the questions, but the Gym was a huge help to me understanding the format and flow of the CTF. After diving into the questions I was becoming a little more confident because I was able to recall a lot of the tools and information that I learned during my SANS GCIH course. However, once I got to the harder questions and certain topics I realized I was stuck.

The first challenge was the Practice Game which ran 1 week long and required a minimum of 60% completion rate of the total questions. I believed that since this was 1 week long, and only a practice, I could take it easy and reach the minimum score with no problem. Except I was wrong. My goal was to complete 1 of the 10 section every day, and with that I would be at around 70% complete. The problem with this, was that would need to get 100% on each section every day. Like I said before, I ran into issues on the harder questions and was unable to solve them, meaning I wasn't going to be able to get 100% on every section. That's when I changed my strategy and tried to answer as many of the questions I could everyday, and not getting stuck on any 1 question or section. Unfortunately, it was too late and I was only able to complete 43.8%.

It was a good and bad thing that I was unable to complete the Practice Game because I then knew what I had to do in order to complete the Individual Game starting 2 weeks later. The individual game also required a 60% minimum completion rate except the real challenge was that it was only 3 days long. It was the same number of sections but even more questions to solve. Going into the game, my strategy was to start strong by starting the Individual Game how I ended the Practice Game. That was, doing as many questions as I could and not getting stuck on any 1 question or section. This worked out great and I was able to make a lot of progress on the first day. However, the second day was were I started to face some burn-out as I was getting stuck on almost every question. I used every resource I could think of from past course material, search engines, and AI tools but it was not enough to answer some of the challenges. I started the third day at about 50% completion and had very few challenges that I might've been able to solve. However, I went back through all of my material and slowly answered enough challenges to reach the 60% goal.

Finally, it was time for the Team Game to start, and it started off rough. We started with no team captain and we ended up losing 2 team members before the game started. Luckily, we were able to get a volunteer team captain, and co-team captain, to set up everything we needed in time for the game's start. It was unfortunate that we only had 4 members on our team, but fortunately enough my team members were great and we were able to get a lot done the first 2 days. The challenges did seem harder on the team game and I was struggling to answer challenges that I could answer on the Individual Game so I felt like I was pulling the team back a little bit. I did my best and tried to help my team where I could, but in reality I learned a lot from them and was happy to be teamed up with them.

Overall, my experience in the NCL Fall 2025 CTF was great and I learned a lot about my strong and weak points. I know now what I need to spend more practice on in order to be better well-rounded. I also learned the practical use of a lot of the things that I learned and was able to see how they work through my own personal experience and I believe that kind of information is the best to have. This was my first CTF event, but I don't think it will be my last. 

## Highlights from my CTF participation

After reflecting on my CTF experience I was able to look back and find some of the highlight moments, and moments that made the CTF experience well worth it. A lot of my highlights come from moments of struggle and moments of doubt. For example, in the Individual Game there was an Open Source Intelligence question that I was stuck on for a long time. I was frustrated that I couldn't figure out the challenge because I had already got most of the important information I needed to solve the challenge. It wasn't until I utilized all of my past notes, material, and knowledge that I was finally able to complete the challenge and climb that hill. I learned from that challenge to utilize every single possible resources because it only takes one thing to reach the next step and get close to completing challenges.

The second, and possibly biggest, highlight from the CTF was during the team challenge. At first I was upset that we were already down many team members and didn't have a team captain, and I thought for sure that we were going to place terribly in the event. However, after talking with my team and going through challenges I was learning a lot more than I did on the other games. Despite being handicapped my team placed very well overall and that was because our team-work and ability to overcome challenges.
